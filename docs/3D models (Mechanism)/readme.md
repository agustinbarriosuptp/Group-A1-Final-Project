# 3D Models (Mechanism)

This folder contains the **3D CAD models** and related files for the mechanical components of our **Robotics Project**. These models are essential for visualizing, designing, and assembling the custom robotic arm and the additional components for the EPSON robot tasks.

## üìÅ Contents
- **CAD Files (.STEP, .SLDPRT):** 3D models of robotic parts, including links, joints, and end effectors.
- **Assembly Files (.SLDASM):** Complete assemblies of the robotic arm and any related mechanisms.
- **Exploded Views:** Illustrations showing the parts in detail for assembly purposes.
