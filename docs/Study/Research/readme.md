# Research: Robotic Manipulator for Automated Stacking Operations

## ðŸ“„ Abstract
This work presents the design and application of a **robotic manipulator** tailored for automated stacking operations in warehouse environments. The robot is equipped to handle **crates and boxes**, efficiently transferring them from pallets to platforms within predefined stacking configurations. 

Key components of the system include:
- **Advanced Kinematic Modeling** for precise manipulation and motion planning, ensuring adaptability to varying box sizes and weights.
- An **optimized end-effector** for secure gripping.
- **Sensory feedback mechanisms** to enhance stacking accuracy and stability.

The proposed solution addresses labor-intensive tasks, offering scalability for integration into larger automated warehousing systems. It aims to contribute to increased **efficiency** and **safety** in logistics operations.
