## Section 1: Introduction to Robotics FINAL PROJECT: Custom Robotic Arm

This section describes our custom-designed **Robotic Arm** project, covering electrical and mechanical engineering.

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Overview

**Project Description:**  
This custom robotic arm is designed to perform manipulation tasks, such as grabbing, moving, and stacking objects. The arm is designed from scratch with a focus on structural design, control systems, and precise movement.
